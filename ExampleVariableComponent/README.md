# Example font

This example font contains two glyphs:

- `/VariableGlyph`, containing a variable rectangle, controllable with two axes:
  `height` and `width`
- `/Box`, which uses the `/Box` variable glyph four times as a component, to form
  a box shape, that responds to the font's `Weight` and `Width` axes
